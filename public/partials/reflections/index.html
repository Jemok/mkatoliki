                <p>March 31, 2016</p>
                <p>Thursday in the Octave of Easter
                    <br> Lectionary: 264</p>
                <p>Reading 1 ACTS 3:11-26</p>
                <p>As the crippled man who had been cured clung to Peter and John,
                    <br> all the people hurried in amazement toward them
                    <br> in the portico called “Solomon’s Portico.”
                    <br> When Peter saw this, he addressed the people,
                    <br> “You children of Israel, why are you amazed at this,
                    <br> and why do you look so intently at us
                    <br> as if we had made him walk by our own power or piety?
                    <br> The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
                    <br> the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus
                    <br> whom you handed over and denied in Pilate’s presence,
                    <br> when he had decided to release him.
                    <br> You denied the Holy and Righteous One
                    <br> and asked that a murderer be released to you.
                    <br> The author of life you put to death,
                    <br> but God raised him from the dead; of this we are witnesses.
                    <br> And by faith in his name,
                    <br> this man, whom you see and know, his name has made strong,
                    <br> and the faith that comes through it
                    <br> has given him this perfect health,
                    <br> in the presence of all of you.
                    <br> Now I know, brothers and sisters,
                    <br> that you acted out of ignorance, just as your leaders did;
                    <br> but God has thus brought to fulfillment
                    <br> what he had announced beforehand
                    <br> through the mouth of all the prophets,
                    <br> that his Christ would suffer.
                    <br> Repent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be wiped away,
                    <br> and that the Lord may grant you times of refreshment
                    <br> and send you the Christ already appointed for you, Jesus,
                    <br> whom heaven must receive until the times of universal restoration
                    <br> of which God spoke through the mouth
                    <br> of his holy prophets from of old.
                    <br> For Moses said:</p>
                <p>A prophet like me will the Lord, your God, raise up for you
                    <br> from among your own kin;
                    <br> to him you shall listen in all that he may say to you.
                    <br> Everyone who does not listen to that prophet
                    <br> will be cut off from the people.</p>
                <p>“Moreover, all the prophets who spoke,
                    <br> from Samuel and those afterwards, also announced these days.
                    <br> You are the children of the prophets
                    <br> and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors
                    <br> when he said to Abraham,
                    <br> In your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
                    <br> For you first, God raised up his servant and sent him to bless you
                    <br> by turning each of you from your evil ways.”</p>

                    <br> PS 8:2AB AND 5, 6-7, 8-9</p>
                <p>R. (2ab) O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!</p>
                <p>or:
                    <br> R. Alleluia.</p>
                <p>O LORD, our Lord,
                    <br> how glorious is your name over all the earth!
                    <br> What is man that you should be mindful of him,
                    <br> or the son of man that you should care for him?
                    <br> R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
                    <br> or:
                    <br> R. Alleluia.
                    <br> You have made him little less than the angels,
                    <br> and crowned him with glory and honor.
                    <br> You have given him rule over the works of your hands,
                    <br> putting all things under his feet.
                    <br> R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
                    <br> or:
                    <br> R. Alleluia.
                    <br> All sheep and oxen,
                    <br> yes, and the beasts of the field,

                    <br> and whatever swims the paths of the seas.
                    <br> R. O Lord, our God, how wonderful your name in all the earth!
                    <br> or:
                    <br> R. Alleluia.
                    <br> Alleluia PS 118:24
                    <br> R. Alleluia, alleluia.
                    <br> This is the day the LORD has made;
                    <br> let us be glad and rejoice in it.
                    <br> R. Alleluia, alleluia.</p>
                <p>Gospel LK 24:35-48</p>
                <p>The disciples of Jesus recounted what had taken place along the way,
                    <br> and how they had come to recognize him in the breaking of bread.</p>
                <p>While they were still speaking about this,
                    <br> he stood in their midst and said to them,
                    <br> “Peace be with you.”
                    <br> But they were startled and terrified
                    <br> and thought that they were seeing a ghost.
                    <br> Then he said to them, “Why are you troubled?
                    <br> And why do questions arise in your hearts?
                    <br> Look at my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.
                    <br> Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones
                    <br> as you can see I have.”
                    <br> And as he said this,
                    <br> he showed them his hands and his feet.
                    <br> While they were still incredulous for joy and were amazed,
                    <br> he asked them, “Have you anything here to eat?”
                    <br> They gave him a piece of baked fish;
                    <br> he took it and ate it in front of them.</p>
                <p>He said to them,
                    <br> “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you,
                    <br> that everything written about me in the law of Moses
                    <br> and in the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.”
                    <br> Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
                    <br> And he said to them,
                    <br> “Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer
                    <br> and rise from the dead on the third day
                    <br> and that repentance, for the forgiveness of sins,
                    <br> would be preached in his name
                    <br> to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
                    <br> You are witnesses of these things.”</p>
